Hey!
If youâ€™re checking out this code... awesome!
Just a heads-up tho: this projectâ€™s still a work in progress 

I still gotta:

Make it fully responsive 

Optimize it for production 

Fix some stuff that breaks after deploying ðŸ˜­

Right now, I donâ€™t really have time to polish it, so donâ€™t be shocked if it doesnâ€™t run perfectly.
If you manage to make it work better or clean it up, send me your version! 
Thatâ€™d save me a ton of time (and Iâ€™ll owe you a coffee â˜•).

Peace out.
